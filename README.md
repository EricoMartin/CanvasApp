# CanvasApp
A simple canvas Assignment

The user can select a shape to be drawn unto the canvas. This implementation does not fulfill all requirements as i need more time to understand some of the concepts of working with the canvas. Also there is no seperation of concerns(MVVM) and consideration for configuration changes as i was solely concentrated on getting functionality to work.
